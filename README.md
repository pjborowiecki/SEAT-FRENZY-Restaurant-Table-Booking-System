**SeatFrenzy** is a restaraunt booking system, allowing visitors to quickly check availability and easily book a table at their favourite restaurant. It also allows restaurant owners to promote their venues by listing them on the website, and to manage their bookings or information displayed on the website.

**<u>This project is currently in development. Please check back soon.</u>**

The goals is not only to make it a table booking system, but also a full restaurant management system, allowing restaurant owners to manage their bookings, menus, and other information displayed on the website.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started <br><br>

#### Prerequisites:

- [Node.js (version 18 or higher)](https://nodejs.org)
- [pNPM](https://pnpm.io)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
  <br>

#### Installation:

<br>

1.  Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone
    ```

    <br>

2.  Install packages

    ```sh
     pnpm install
    ```

    <br>

3.  Rename a `.env.example` file in the project's root directory and fill in the required values. See below for details on obtaining the keys:
    <br>

    - **Clerk:** <br><br>

      - Create a new account with [Clerk](https://clerk.com)
      - _ToDo:_ Complete the setup instructions <br><br>

    - **PlanetScale:** <br><br>

      - Create a new account with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)
      - _ToDo:_ Complete the setup instructions <br><br>

    - **UploadThing:** <br><br>

      - Create a new account with [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com)
      - _ToDo:_ Complete the setup instructions <br><br>

    - **Ngrok**: <br><br>

      - _NOTE_: The reason for using Ngrok is to sync users data to our backend. Since authentication and user management happens on Clerk's side, data eventually need to reach the application's back end to allow for creating more complex relations in our database schemas. Clerk provides a way to do that via webhooks, but it requires a public URL. Ngrok allows us to create a tunnel to our local server, so we can test the webhooks locally. The details of the setup can be found [here](https://clerk.com/docs/users/sync-data-to-your-backend). See [this page](https://ngrok.com/docs/integrations/clerk/webhooks/) for instructions on how to set up Ngrok with Clerk for local development.

      ![clerkNgrokWebhookIllustration](https://clerk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fe1ql88v4%2Fproduction%2F344b217021b87801cc586c96df20c0fd713a795c-2775x2106.png%3Ffit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat&w=1920&q=75)

      - Ensure you have ngrok installed on your machine
      - Create a new account at [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
      - Go to `Yout Authtoken` tab on the left-hand side of the dashboard and copy the token
      - Run `ngrok config add-authtoken <your_auth_token>` in your terminal window <br><br>

    - **Svix:** <br><br>

      - _NOTE_: Because of the way webhooks work, attackers can impersonate services by simply sending a fake webhook to an endpoint. Think about it: it's just an HTTP POST from an unknown source. This is a potential security hole for many applications, or at the very least, a source of problems. In order to prevent it, Svix signs every webhook and its metadata with a unique key for each endpoint. This signature can then be used to verify the webhook indeed comes from Svix, and only process it if it is. <br><br>

      - Create a new account with [Svix](https://svix.com)
      - Follow the instructions to add a new app by pasting the commands given in your dashboard into your terminal window
      - Create a new API Access token and add it to your `.env` file as `SVIX_AUTHTOKEN`<br><br>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p><br>

#### Development: <br><br>

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   <br>

5. Start the ngrok tunnel in another terminal window

   ```sh
    ngrok http 3000
   ```

   <br>

6. Copy the forwarding address (e.g., https://ffe6-185-171-71-142.ngrok-free.app) from the terminal output <br><br>

7. Go to your Clerk account dashboard, click on `Webhooks` tab on the left-hand side menu, and click on `Add Webhook` button. Paste the forwarding address into the `Endpoint Url` field. Scroll to the bottom of the `Message Filtering` section and select all user events: `user.created`, `user.deleted`, and `user.updated`. Click on `Create` button. <br><br>

8. Copy the `Signing Secret` from the `Webhooks` tab and add it to your `.env` file as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. <br><br>

9. Detailed instructions for testing can be found [here](https://ngrok.com/docs/integrations/clerk/webhooks/). The output from step 5 should include a `Web Interface` local address, which is usually [http://localhost:4040](https://localhost:4040) and can be accessed for inspecting the webhook requests. When you click on a request, you can see details of both the request and the response. <br><br>

10. Your app should be available at [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
    <br>
