/**
 * TODO
 * There probably is a better way to handle checking for a valid venue
 * I'm still not sure how exactly drizzle deems failures, maybe it isn't null that's returned?
 * Also, we may not even need the venue validation, need to research what level the drizzle foreign keys work on
 * Wait, I could test this by adding one
 * Not sure why I'm writing out my thoughts now but have fun reading it :D
 * Ok, the relations in drizzle are not checked at runtime or something, don't act as foreign keys
 * Will need to add the check in here for venueId then
 * Will also need to make isValidVenue async/await, but then change safeParse in the add action to parseAsync or something
 * Have fun with this part ;)
